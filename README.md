	•	Developed an innovative machine learning tool in Python for predicting outage probability in Ambient Backscattering Communication (ABC) systems.
	•	Utilized high-precision numerical calculations using the mpmath library to handle sensitive data parameters with precision up to 22 decimal places.
	•	Processed and normalized critical parameters such as ρt, ρ, σsr, ν, and target variables Po|0 and Po|1 with min-max normalization to ensure model accuracy.
	•	Designed and trained a neural network using TensorFlow with float64 precision for improved prediction accuracy.
	•	Split data into training and testing sets to validate model performance and implemented standardized scaling using scikit-learn’s StandardScaler.
	•	Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, mpmath, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn.
